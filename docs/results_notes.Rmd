# Phase 2 â€” Reproduced Figure Notes (GSE202177)

**Unit of analysis:** Human leukocytes (blood), males only  
**Contrast:** FXS vs Control  
**Subset size used:** FXS: __, Control: __ (from Series matrix)  
**Files:** normalized counts = `GSE202177_normalized_gene_counts.csv.gz`; metadata from GEO Series Matrix  
**Key metadata fields:** `characteristics_ch1.2` (genotype: FXS/TD)

## Data wrangling notes
- Column name fixes: (e.g., removed trailing underscore from `<sample>`).
- Mapping: expression columns matched to `meta$title`.
- Any samples dropped: (yes/no, reason).

## QC
- Gene filter for PCA: removed zero-variance genes; kept top N most variable.
- PCA takeaway: (e.g., modest separation by group; no obvious outliers).

## Differences vs paper
- Paper blood cohort: ~10 FXS / 7 Control; I used __ / __ (broader leukocyte set).
- Covariates: none used (all male; no additional recorded covariates).

## Next steps
- (Optional) Refine to exact 10/7 arm; reproduce volcano with author DE table or run DE from raw counts.
